        <h2>Border collie</h2>
        <p>According to The Intelligence of Dogs, which ranks 131 dog breeds in terms of their relative intelligence, the border collie is the smartest dog breed known to man. Need proof? Chaser, a linguistically gifted border collie from South Carolina, could recognize over 1,000 words. But it’s not just a matter of being “book smart.” A descendant of European herding dogs that lived along the rocky borders of England, Scotland, and Wales, the border collie was bred to be crafty enough and athletic enough to survive the treacherous landscape. It’s also blessed with a strong work ethic. The AKC, which recognized the breed in 1995, describes the border collie not only as “smart, affectionate, and energetic,” but also as a “remarkably bright workaholic.”</p>
        <p>Border collie owners should be prepared to provide their doggo with lots of mental and physical stimulation, according to the AKC. The breed is so intelligent and good at communicating with humans that it’s not unreasonable to imagine that many are quite adept at getting what they want from their owners. That’s why we’re proclaiming the border collie the smartest dog in the world.</p>
